## Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

**Objective:**  
Understand how browser extensions can impact security by reviewing, analyzing, and removing potentially unsafe or unused extensions from your browser.

### Tools Used:
- Google Chrome (Extensions Manager)
- Firefox (Add-ons Manager)
- Online extension review websites (e.g., Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons)

### What I Did:
- Opened the **browser extension manager** and reviewed all installed extensions.
- Checked each extension for:
  - **Permissions requested**
  - **User reviews and ratings**
  - **Last update date**
  - **Publisher credibility**
- Identified extensions that were:
  - No longer used
  - Suspicious or had excessive permissions
- Removed the suspicious/unnecessary ones.
- Restarted the browser and observed any performance changes.
- Researched **how malicious extensions steal data, track users, or inject ads.**
- Documented the steps and extensions involved.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Gained awareness of **browser extension-related threats**.
- Understood the **risk of over-permissioned extensions**.
- Learned how **malicious extensions disguise themselves** as useful tools.
- Practiced safe extension management: install from trusted sources, review permissions, and uninstall unused add-ons.

### Key Concepts Covered:
`Browser Security`, `Extensions & Permissions`, `Malware`, `Data Privacy`, `Sandboxing`, `Security Best Practices`

### Reflection Questions I Explored:
- What permissions are a red flag when evaluating extensions?
- Can browser extensions read or steal passwords?
- Whatâ€™s the difference between plugins and extensions?
- How does extension sandboxing protect users?
- How can malicious extensions be reported or flagged?
