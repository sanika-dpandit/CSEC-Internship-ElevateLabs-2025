Extra Research
How Malicious Browser Extensions Harm Users:

Malicious extensions can steal sensitive data such as passwords, cookies, and browsing history.

They may inject ads, trackers, or malware into webpages, compromising privacy and performance.

Extensions with broad permissions can redirect traffic to phishing sites or exploit peer-to-peer networks (e.g., Hola VPN).

Some extensions act as botnets, using your device’s resources without consent.

They can spy on user activity, logging keystrokes or capturing screenshots.

Best Practices for Managing Extensions:

Only install extensions from trusted sources with good reviews.

Regularly review and remove unused or suspicious extensions.

Pay close attention to permissions requested—excessive access to all websites or data is a red flag.

Keep extensions updated to patch security vulnerabilities.

Use browsers that support extension sandboxing to limit impact.

Reporting Malicious Extensions:

Use browser stores’ built-in "Report Abuse" feature.

Report unusual behavior or security concerns promptly.

Interview Questions Answered (Summary)
Browser extensions can pose serious security risks by requesting excessive permissions, which allow them to access sensitive data or modify web content. Permissions like full access to all websites or ability to read and change data are suspicious if not justified. Safe extension installation requires verifying the source, checking user reviews, and limiting permissions. Extension sandboxing is a security feature that isolates extensions from the rest of the browser environment to minimize damage. Malicious extensions can steal passwords, inject ads, or track users. Regular updates are necessary to fix vulnerabilities. Extensions differ from plugins in scope and technology. Malicious extensions should be reported via browser store mechanisms to protect other users.
