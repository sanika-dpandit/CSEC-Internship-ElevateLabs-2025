## Task 2: Phishing Email Detection and Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze a suspicious email to identify common phishing characteristics, helping to build awareness and skills in email threat detection.

**Tools Used:**  
- Sample phishing email (publicly available)  
- Email header analyzer (e.g., Google Admin Toolbox, MxToolbox)  
- Web browser for link verification  
- Text editor for documenting findings

### What I Did:
- Acquired a known phishing email sample
- Verified sender email for spoofing indicators
- Used an online header analyzer to review discrepancies in header data
- Hovered over embedded links to detect mismatched URLs
- Identified urgent, threatening, or manipulative language in the message
- Checked for common phishing signs like:
  - Grammatical errors
  - Fake sender identity
  - Misleading URLs
  - Suspicious attachments

### Learning Outcomes:
- Developed an understanding of how phishing emails are structured
- Learned techniques to spot spoofed email addresses and mismatched links
- Understood how email headers can be used for deeper threat analysis
- Improved ability to critically evaluate suspicious messages
