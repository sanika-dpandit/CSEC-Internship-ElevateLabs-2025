## Task 1: Network Port Scanning using Nmap

**Objective:**  
Perform network reconnaissance by scanning your local network for open ports using Nmap to understand potential security exposures.

**Tools Used:**  
- Nmap (for TCP SYN scanning)  
- Wireshark (optional, for packet analysis)

**What I Did:**  
- Identified the IP range of my local network  
- Performed a TCP SYN scan using Nmap to detect active hosts and open ports  
- Analyzed the scan results to understand what services were running  
- Documented findings and noted potential risks associated with the discovered ports  
- Saved the results and added them to this repo for reference  

**Learning Outcomes:**  
- Gained practical experience with Nmap  
- Understood how port scanning reveals network vulnerabilities  
- Learned how to interpret scan results and identify risky services  

**Key Concepts Covered:**  
`TCP SYN Scan`, `Open Ports`, `IP Ranges`, `Network Reconnaissance`, `Service Discovery`, `Basic Threat Analysis`

**Interview-Style Reflection Questions I Explored:**  
- What is an open port and why is it important?  
- How does a TCP SYN scan differ from other types of scans?  
- What risks do open ports present to an organization?  
- How can open ports be secured effectively?
