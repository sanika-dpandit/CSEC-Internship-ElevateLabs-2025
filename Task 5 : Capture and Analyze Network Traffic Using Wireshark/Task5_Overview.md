## Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

**Objective:**  
Perform live network traffic capture and identify multiple protocols using Wireshark. This task focuses on developing packet inspection and protocol analysis skills.

### Tools Used:
- **Wireshark** â€“ Free and open-source packet analyzer for network troubleshooting and analysis.

### What I Did:
- Installed and launched Wireshark on my machine.
- Started live packet capture on my active network interface.
- Visited websites and used `ping` to simulate different traffic types.
- Stopped the capture after about 1 minute.
- Applied protocol filters (e.g., `http`, `dns`, `tcp`) to narrow down the traffic.
- Identified and documented **at least three protocols** from the capture.
- Exported the session as a `.pcap` file.
- Wrote a brief analysis summarizing what the packets revealed about network behavior.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Understood how to capture and analyze live network traffic.
- Learned to recognize different internet protocols and their roles in communication.
- Improved practical skills in using filters and interpreting data in Wireshark.
- Gained familiarity with `.pcap` files and how to use them for troubleshooting.

### Key Concepts Covered:
`Wireshark`, `Packet Analysis`, `TCP/IP`, `HTTP`, `DNS`, `Filtering`, `.pcap`, `Protocol Layers`, `Network Monitoring`

### Reflection Questions I Explored:
- What makes TCP different from UDP?
- How does DNS function at the packet level?
- What kind of data is visible in a packet capture?
- How can Wireshark be used to detect network issues or potential threats?
- Can encrypted traffic be fully analyzed using Wireshark?
