# Task 8: Working and Understanding VPN

## Objective:
To explore the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in enhancing online privacy and securing network communication through hands-on setup, testing, and analysis.

## Tools Used:
- **ProtonVPN** (Free Tier)  
  _or_  
- **Windscribe VPN** (Free Version)
- [whatismyipaddress.com](https://www.whatismyipaddress.com/) for IP verification

## What I Did:
1. Researched and chose a **trusted free VPN service** (ProtonVPN).
2. **Created an account**, downloaded, and installed the VPN client.
3. Connected to a **VPN server** (nearest available).
4. Verified **change in IP address** using an online IP-checking tool.
5. **Browsed websites** to ensure encrypted traffic was flowing.
6. Disconnected VPN and compared:
   - IP before and after connection
   - Internet speed and latency
7. Studied **VPN encryption**, tunneling protocols, and how it enhances privacy.
8. Documented all steps with **screenshots** and wrote a short report.

## Key Concepts Learned:
- What is a VPN and how it works
- **IP masking** and encrypted tunneling
- VPN **protocols** (e.g., OpenVPN, IKEv2)
- How VPNs **protect against surveillance and unsecured Wi-Fi risks**
- VPN **limitations** (e.g., reduced speed, false sense of complete anonymity)

## Reflection Questions Explored:
-  How does a VPN secure traffic?
-  Does a VPN slow down internet speed?
-  Difference between VPN and proxy?
-  Can VPNs guarantee total anonymity?
-  What protocols and encryption standards do VPNs use?

## Outcome:
Hands-on understanding of how VPNs work, real-world privacy benefits, encryption basics, and how to evaluate a VPNâ€™s effectiveness and limitations in various use cases.
