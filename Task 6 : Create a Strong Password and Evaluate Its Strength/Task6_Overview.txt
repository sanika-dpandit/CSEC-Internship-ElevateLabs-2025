## Task 6: Create and Evaluate Strong Passwords

**Objective:**  
Understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple variants and evaluating their strength using online tools. This task highlights the role of password complexity in defending against common attack methods.

### Tools Used:
- Free online password strength checkers like:
  - [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
  - [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
  - [NordPass Strength Checker](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-checker/)

### What I Did:
- Created a variety of passwords with different structures:
  - Simple (e.g., `sunshine123`)
  - Moderate (e.g., `MyDog2022!`)
  - Strong (e.g., `T!g3r#W1nter_88`)
- Tested each password using multiple online strength checkers.
- Recorded:
  - Strength scores
  - Feedback from tools
  - Suggestions for improvement
- Researched how password characteristics affect vulnerability to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Summarized key takeaways and password security tips.

### Learning Outcomes:
- Gained a practical understanding of what factors make passwords secure.
- Identified patterns that result in weak vs. strong password scores.
- Learned about password attack methods and how complexity helps prevent them.
- Understood the value of **passphrases**, **length**, and **entropy**.
- Explored the importance of **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **password managers**.

### Key Concepts Covered:
`Password Strength`, `Brute-force Attacks`, `Dictionary Attacks`, `Authentication`, `Passphrases`, `Best Practices`, `MFA`, `Password Managers`

### Reflection Questions I Explored:
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a weak and a strong password?
- Why does password length matter more than symbols alone?
- What are the dangers of reusing passwords?
- How do attackers attempt to crack passwords?
- Are password managers safe and effective?
