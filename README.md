# Cyber Security Internship Projects

Welcome to my Cyber Security Internship repository! This contains all the tasks completed during the internship, including a bonus Steganography project. Each folder includes the relevant documentation, screenshots, code, tools used, and insights gained.

## Tasks Overview

| Task | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [Task 1](./Task-1-Network-Scan) | Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports | Performed network reconnaissance using Nmap to find open ports and understand local network exposure. |
| [Task 2](./Task-2-Phishing-Email-Analysis) | Analyze a Phishing Email Sample | Inspected a phishing email and headers to identify spoofing, suspicious URLs, and malicious intent. |
| [Task 3](./Task-3-Vulnerability-Scan) | Perform a Vulnerability Scan | Used OpenVAS/Nessus Essentials to identify common PC vulnerabilities and assessed risk levels. |
| [Task 4](./Task-4-Firewall-Setup) | Setup and Use a Firewall | Configured UFW (Linux) / Windows Firewall to block and allow traffic on specific ports. |
| [Task 5](./Task-5-Wireshark-Traffic-Analysis) | Capture and Analyze Network Traffic | Captured live packets with Wireshark and identified various protocols in use. |
| [Task 6](./Task-6-Password-Security) | Create a Strong Password | Tested password strength using online tools and explored common password attack techniques. |
| [Task 7](./Task-7-Browser-Extension-Audit) | Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions | Audited browser extensions and removed suspicious or unused ones to improve security. |
| [Steganography Project](./Steganography-Project) | Image Steganography with Python | Encoded and decoded hidden messages in images using Python, demonstrating data concealment techniques. |

## Skills Gained

- Port scanning and TCP/UDP understanding
- Email threat analysis and phishing detection
- Vulnerability scanning and CVSS scoring
- Firewall configuration and port blocking
- Packet sniffing and protocol analysis
- Password strength and brute-force prevention
- Browser extension security
- Steganography (image-based data hiding)

## Tools Used

- Nmap
- Wireshark
- Nessus Essentials / OpenVAS
- UFW / Windows Firewall
- Python (for steganography)
- Passwordmeter.com
- Web browsers (Chrome/Firefox)

## Repository Structure

Each task has:
- A `README.md` explaining steps taken
- Screenshots or reports
- Code/config files (if applicable)

> **Note:** All tasks were performed on a local system or virtual environment. No paid tools were used. All reports and screenshots are original.
