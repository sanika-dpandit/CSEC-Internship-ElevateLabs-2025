## Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan on Local Machine

**Objective:**  
Use a free vulnerability scanner (OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials) to identify potential security issues on your personal system and understand risk severity and remediation options.

**Tools Used:**  
- Nessus Essentials *(free version by Tenable)*  
  or  
- OpenVAS *(Open-source vulnerability scanner)*

### What I Did:
- Installed and configured the vulnerability scanner (Nessus Essentials in my case)
- Set my local machine IP (`127.0.0.1` / actual IP) as the scan target
- Launched a full system scan and waited for the scan to complete
- Analyzed the generated report:
  - Reviewed vulnerability severity levels using CVSS scores
  - Identified the top 5 most critical vulnerabilities
  - Took screenshots and documented results
- Researched potential fixes or mitigation steps for critical findings

### Learning Outcomes:
- Understood how vulnerability scanners identify known security flaws
- Gained experience analyzing CVSS scores and prioritizing threats
- Learned how to interpret reports and relate findings to real-world risks

### Key Concepts Covered:
`Vulnerability Scanning`, `CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)`, `Risk Assessment`, `False Positives`, `Remediation`, `Security Posture`, `System Hardening`

### Reflection Questions I Explored:
- What is the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
- What types of vulnerabilities are commonly found on personal machines?
- What is CVSS and how does it help in risk prioritization?
- How can false positives be identified and managed?
- What steps can be taken to remediate critical system vulnerabilities?
