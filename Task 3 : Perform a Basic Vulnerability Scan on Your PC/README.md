# basic-vulnerability-scan

Objective
Perform a basic vulnerability assessment on a local Windows machine using Tenable Nessus Essentials. 
This task is part of a cybersecurity internship exercise to understand vulnerability scanning, risk assessment, and CVSS scoring.

Tools Used
Nessus Essentials (free edition)
- Local Windows 10 virtual machine

 Steps Performed

1. Installed Nessus Essentials
2. Registered for activation key
3. Performed plugin sync and allowed compilation
4. Created a basic scan targeting `127.0.0.1`
5. Started a full vulnerability scan
6. Reviewed scan report and exported results
7. Documented key vulnerabilities and fixes

Scan Setup
- Target: `localhost` (my own machine)
- Scan Type: Host Discovery Scan
- Scan Duration: ~30–45 minutes
- Scanner Tool: Nessus Essentials

  Scan Configuration

- Scan Template: Basic Network Scan
- Target: `127.0.0.1` (local machine)
- Port Scanning: Enabled (default settings)
- Credentials: None (unauthenticated scan)

 Notable Vulnerabilities
1. OpenSSH User Enumeration
- CVSS Score: 7.5 (High)
- Fix: Update to a newer version or configure SSHD to disable detailed error messages.

2. SMBv1 Enabled
- CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)
- Fix: Disable SMBv1 protocol via Windows Features or Registry.

  Extra Research Insight
While unauthenticated scans like the one performed using Nessus Essentials provide a solid overview of surface-level vulnerabilities, they often miss deeper issues related to application logic, internal configurations, or authenticated-only services. To simulate real-world attack surfaces more closely, many organizations implement authenticated scanning, which allows tools to log in and detect misconfigurations, outdated software, or exposed sensitive files with higher accuracy. Additionally, integrating vulnerability scanning into a continuous monitoring strategy—such as through scheduled scans, ticketing systems for remediation, and patch management automation—helps reduce risk exposure windows. Combining scanning with penetration testing further validates the exploitability of high-severity findings.

Vulnerability Scanning Interview Q&A Summary
Vulnerability scanning is the automated process of inspecting systems for known security flaws, misconfigurations, or outdated software that could be exploited by attackers. It’s an essential first step in proactive cybersecurity defense and is commonly used in both enterprise and personal environments. Unlike penetration testing, which attempts to actively exploit vulnerabilities to assess impact, scanning is non-intrusive and focuses on identifying and categorizing weaknesses. Common personal computer vulnerabilities include outdated services like SMBv1, misconfigured firewalls, weak credentials, and unpatched software.

Scanners like Nessus use plugin databases, CVE identifiers, and banner grabbing techniques to detect vulnerabilities. They cross-reference system data with known threat signatures, assigning severity levels using metrics like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), which helps rate risk from low to critical. Scans should be run regularly—ideally monthly or after major software updates—to maintain visibility over potential threats. However, scanners can produce false positives, which are flagged issues that don’t actually pose a threat, often due to signature inaccuracies or environmental variations.

Prioritizing vulnerabilities involves evaluating CVSS scores, asset importance, network exposure, and exploit availability. For instance, a critical vulnerability on a public-facing server should be addressed immediately, while a low-severity issue on an isolated test machine may be less urgent. Effective vulnerability management is about both detection and intelligent response.
